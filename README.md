# [Hermes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes) 🏃💨

This is a combination of a couple awesome packages [scrape]() and [fetchbot]() that will crawl a list of links and scrape the pages.

The premise behind all of this is that I wanted to have sort of an all in one way to crawl through sites and scrape it's content to store into an Elasticsearch index.

The next few things I will need to do is ...
- [ ] add in some ingestion features for the Documents (scraped pages) to be uploaded to a configurable Elasticsearch instance
- [ ] clean up the code to make it more reusable and modular
- [ ] create a solid way for people to incorporate these features into their own applications
